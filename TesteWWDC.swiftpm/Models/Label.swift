Drag the jewelry to the knapsack to add Tap the jewelry in the knapsack inventory to withdraw Pay attention to the weight and value of each jewelry and the capacity of the knapsack! We want a combination that has the highest value depending on the capacity of the knapsack. Tap the zipper to finish and give the knapsack to Julia!"

    static let textPerfectScene : String = "Wee! You did it! We made the best possible profit and my knapsack looks great! Thanks for your help, it's not so easy to think of a solution to this problem. You can play again, or understand a little more about the knapsack problem!"
    static let textLExplicationScene : String = "The knapsack problem is a combinatorial optimization problem I learned about in Artificial Intelligence class. The objective is to know the greatest value that I can have in my knapsack from a set of objects, each with its own values and weights, respecting the knapsack's capacity limit. The knapsack is just a simple example of the applications of this problem in the real world, such as: loading cargo, cutting parts, budget control, among other situations that involve maximizing profit or minimizing losses."
