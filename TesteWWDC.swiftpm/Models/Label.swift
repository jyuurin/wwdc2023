Drag the jewelry set to the knapsack to add | Tap on the jewelry set in the knapsack inventory to withdraw | Pay attention to the number of pieces and price of each jewelry set and the capacity of the knapsack! We want a combination that has the highest price depending on the capacity of the knapsack. Tap the zipper to finish and give the knapsack to Julia!"

    static let textPerfectScene : String = "Wee! You did it! We made the best possible profit and my knapsack looks great! Thanks for your help, it's not so easy to think of a solution to this problem. You can play again, or understand a little more about the knapsack problem!"
    static let textLExplicationScene : String = "The knapsack problem is a combinatorial optimization problem I learned about in Artificial Intelligence class. The objective is to know the greatest price that I can have in my knapsack from a set of objects, each with its own prices and weights, respecting the knapsack's capacity limit. The knapsack is just a simple example of the applications of this problem in the real world, such as: loading cargo, cutting parts, budget control, among other situations that involve maximizing profit or minimizing losses."
